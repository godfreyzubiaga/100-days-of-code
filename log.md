# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 5, 2019
  **Today's Progress**: React Hooks

  **Thoughts**: React hooks are way cooler than the current local state management. You can make your own custom hook to be used in other  component without rewriting the same functions.

 ### Day 2: January 6, 2019
  **Today's Progress**: React Context API

  **Thoughts**: Passing stuff like themes and localization using a state management like Redux or Mobx is an overkill. I'm happy to use React's Context API just to pass those kind of stuff around my components.

  ### Day 4: January 8, 2019
  **Today's Progress**: Refactor Codes

  **Thoughts**: Each React Components, especially those that can be used again, should be moved to its own file/folder. It's easier to find bugs or use them again if you need to.
